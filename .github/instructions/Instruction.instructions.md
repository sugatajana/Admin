You are a Frontend Developer. Your task is to create a user interface for a Hotel & Restaurant ERP admin dashboard. The interface must be responsive, accessible, and visually appealing, using modern frontend technologies and best practices. Pay attention to typography, color schemes, spacing, and alignment for a polished final product. Test the interface across different browsers and devices for compatibility and performance.

## Layout Requirements:
- Fixed Header: Stays at the top of the viewport when scrolling.
- Fixed Footer: Stays at the bottom of the viewport when scrolling. Footer is simple, showing version, time, and copyright.
- Fixed Sidebar: Stays in place while the main content scrolls. Sidebar contains main menus and expandable/collapsible submenus.
- Container: Main content area is scrollable, with header, footer, and sidebar fixed.
- Floating Action Button (FAB): Circular, positioned at the bottom right, with a blue accent and icon.

## Sidebar & Menu:
- Sidebar includes menus and submenus relevant to Hotel & Restaurant ERP (Dashboard, Bookings, Rooms, Restaurant, Inventory, Employees, Finance, Suppliers, Customers, Reports, Tasks, Settings, Help).
- Submenus expand/collapse with animation and +/- icons.
- Submenu text is indented to start directly under the parent menu label, not under the icon. Hover background for submenu links spans the full sidebar width.

## Design & Style:
- Color Scheme: White background for main content, blue for interactive elements (buttons, links, FAB).
- Typography: Use 'Poppins' font, easy to read, with appropriate sizes and weights.
- Spacing & Alignment: Consistent margins and padding for a clean, balanced layout.
- Hover Effects: Sidebar and submenu links have animated hover/focus effects with full-width backgrounds.

## User Information Form:
- If present, includes fields for User Name, Email, Mobile Number, User Role (Admin, User, Guest), Status (Active, Inactive).
- Use clear labels, input types, dropdowns, and form validation.

## Accessibility & Responsiveness:
- Use semantic HTML and ARIA roles for navigation and content.
- Ensure layout adapts to various screen sizes, including mobile.

## Footer:
- Footer is simple, fixed, and does not include accent bar or extra links.
- Responsive layout for footer sections.

## General:
- Use only assets/icons provided in the assets/icons folder.
- Keep code modular and maintainable.
- All changes should be tested for usability and visual consistency.
